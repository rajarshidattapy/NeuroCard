# NeuroCard: Your NeuroCardiac digital twin!
------




Frontend (React with TypeScript)
Main Components:

Dashboard: Shows real-time ECG and EEG monitoring with key health metrics
Digital Twin: 3D visualization using Three.js with interactive controls
Alerts: System for displaying health anomalies with severity levels
Recommendations: Personalized health suggestions and medication schedules
Utilities:

Custom hooks for data fetching (useECGData, useEEGData, useAnomalies)
API service for backend communication
Three.js helper functions for 3D visualization
Constants for consistent data representation
Libraries:

React Three Fiber & Drei for 3D rendering
Chart.js for data visualization
Axios for API requests
Tailwind CSS for styling
Lucide React for icons
Backend (Python with FastAPI)
Core Components:

FastAPI application with CORS middleware
Data models using Pydantic
API routes for ECG, EEG, anomalies, and recommendations
Services for data processing and analysis
Sample data generation for demonstration
Features:

ECG and EEG data processing
Anomaly detection
Health recommendations
Medication scheduling
The development server is now running, and you can see the application in the preview. The structure follows your requested organization with separate frontend and backend directories.

To fully implement this system with real data, you would need to:

Connect to actual EEG/ECG devices or data sources
Implement the machine learning models for real-time analysis
Create a proper database for storing patient data
Enhance the 3D visualization with accurate anatomical models
